1
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,360
Great.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:15,810
So we basically created a structure in our TerraForm project, which is actually a structure, a common

3
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,670
standard way of structuring your TerraForm project.

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:28,500
We have created modules where we logically grouped similar resources that belong together into own modules

5
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,510
while still creating one of the resources outside.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:39,480
We also learned how to use those modules, how to reference them and pass on different values that we

7
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:46,740
configured inside the modules themselves, as well as we learn how to reference the resource objects

8
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:54,150
inside the modules itself, using this module reference and then basically just access any attributes

9
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,930
of their object.

10
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,470
So our project looks great.

11
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,700
We have all the resources parameterized, which is actually a best practice.

12
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:08,400
So all the values are set in one place in the TFN file.

13
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,490
So if something changes, we just adjust in one place and we don't need to worry about adjusting the

14
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,660
rest of the configuration.

15
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:24,120
And as the last part, we can just commit everything to get let's actually see the status of all the

16
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,710
changes.

17
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:25,650
There you go.

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,180
We have modules and we have basically adjusted everything.

19
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,290
So I'm going to add all the changes.

20
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:41,610
Let's commit modularize terraform project.

21
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:56,010
The reform push will give us said upstream for our branch, which doesn't exist remotely yet, and we

22
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,330
can just push the whole branch and there you go.

23
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:06,420
We have our module configuration in the remote branch, if you want to reference it later.
