1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:11,130
Now is a first step we need to install TerraForm locally so we can start using it, and obviously based

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,450
on which operating system you're using, the installation will be a bit different.

3
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:25,440
So either you can install it using a package manager tool on Linux or make or you can just download

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:32,070
TerraForm Binary from TerraForm official page and then set it up locally yourself.

5
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:40,620
And this applies to Windows, Linux and Mic, and you will find links to how to install TerraForm on

6
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,970
different operating systems.

7
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,460
In the video description So check it out there and do the installation on your OS.

8
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,270
And once you have TerraForm, then you can move on with the tutorial.

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,080
Now, if you're on, make the easiest way to install.

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:03,440
TerraForm is using Prew package manager used to brew install tier form.

11
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:12,420
And this will install TerraForm, and once you have it installed, then you can use TerraForm version.

12
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:22,570
And if you have an output of TerraForm version, it means it is correctly installed and configured.

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,900
Since TerraForm is widely used to automate energy use infrastructure, and because E.W. is is the most

14
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:39,640
popular cloud platform out there, we will use IWC as an example to learn all TerraForm concepts.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,050
However, note that all these will be very similar to using TerraForm for other platforms and technologies.

16
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:54,940
In this part, I'm going to show you how to write TerraForm File that connects to your A.W. account,

17
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:02,740
and we will create a VPC and subnet in our account just to learn the basic concepts of TerraForm and

18
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,520
its syntax.

19
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:09,880
So the first thing we need is we're going to create a project folder called TerraForm.

20
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,350
So let's create a folder called TerraForm,

21
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,090
and we're going to start creating files in that folder.

22
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,820
Now that's actually open visual studio code and create a new file here.

23
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,120
And let's say it into our TerraForm folder that we just created.

24
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:38,020
And let's call it Main Dot Taf T.f, since whatever form and main is just the name we give.

25
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,610
You can name it whatever you want.

26
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:46,060
This is just a standard for calling the main TerraForm file window to t.f.

27
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,920
So let's create this file.

28
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:54,670
And if you're working in Visual Studio, you can actually install a plugin for TerraForm.

29
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,580
There is actually the official one from Hershey Corp TerraForm.

30
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,980
However, I have installed another one, which actually looks pretty good because of syntax highlighting.

31
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:11,860
But whichever plugin you want, just install one so that we have a nice syntax highlighting in our file.
