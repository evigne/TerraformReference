1
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:13,360
Now, what we're going to do as the next step is create a good repository for our TerraForm project,

2
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:19,870
so whatever changes we make to artier from configuration, we can actually work with the repository.

3
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:28,330
So we have a history of the changes and also other team members can check out the code and work on the

4
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,440
same project as well.

5
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:37,990
So first of all, I'm going to go to get Lip UI and here I'm just going to create a new blank project.

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,610
Let's call it TerraForm

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:43,990
Learn.

8
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,700
So inside the company will be probably a private repository.

9
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,930
I'm going to make it public so that others can access my project here.

10
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:06,190
The remote repository exists in Ditlev, so we can connect our local project to the remote repository,

11
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,950
so it means that we are going to make it into a good project.

12
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,620
So even here, I mean the root folder of the project.

13
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,730
So we're going to do it in it.

14
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,630
And this will initialize an empty repository.

15
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:27,670
And what we're going to do is we are going to connect it to the remote.

16
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:27,930
Right.

17
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,200
Put an existing folder.

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,800
So you already have a existing repository.

19
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:41,620
So our existing code and what you need to do is get remote at origin and it will point to the remote

20
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,730
project, which is this one right here.

21
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,320
So I'm going to execute it.

22
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:53,770
And now if I do get status, it tells me that I have to check in all these code.

23
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,480
Right now is the next step before we actually check in everything that we have.

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:09,150
We're going to create a get ignore file because the thing is, we don't need to check all of this information

25
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,540
or all of these files to the repository.

26
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,260
Some of the files shouldn't be checked into the repository.

27
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:22,370
And let me create a kit, ignore file, and then we're going to see what these files are.

28
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,210
So get ignored.

29
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,350
So the first thing we're going to ignore in the changes.

30
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:34,040
So what we're not going to check into the repository is this DOD terraform folder here.

31
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:39,630
This basically just stores the providers that are installed locally.

32
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,710
So it doesn't have to be part of the code when you do terraform in it.

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,280
This will be downloaded on your computer locally.

34
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,490
So we don't have to check that in and we're going to ignore it.

35
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,230
Let's actually add a comment here.

36
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,580
Local terraformed directory.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,230
And we are going to.

38
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,380
And we're going to ignore the whole folder.

39
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,670
Another thing we want to ignore is not chicken is terraformed state because obviously terraformed state

40
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,070
is a generated file that gets updated every time we do terraform a play.

41
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,180
And this is a local state when you are playing around and doing a play.

42
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:25,900
So we're going to ignore this one as well to our form states file or files.

43
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,380
We have two of them.

44
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,780
We have the current state and we have the previous one.

45
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,730
So we're going to ignore both of them.

46
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,740
So let's do.

47
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:41,340
He stayed so every file with this extension as well as dot pick up.

48
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:51,740
What we also going to ignore is the terraform variable files, and the reason why is that, as I said,

49
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:59,240
terraformed variables are basically a way to give users of terraform, maybe other team members a way

50
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,440
to set the parameters for the configuration file.

51
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,550
And these parameters will be different based on which environment you are using.

52
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,580
So changes depending on the environment.

53
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:18,350
And also these variables file may actually contain some sensitive data, could be password, private

54
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,480
keys of the users themselves.

55
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:28,190
So, for example, you may be pointing to your private SSL keys or some certificates and other secrets

56
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,060
could be different for different team members.

57
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:38,570
So we're going to ignore the terraformed variables file so each user of this reform project should have

58
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,220
their own copy locally.

59
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:50,300
So they're able, let's say to your variable files may include sensitive data,

60
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,260
T.F. Vast.

61
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:54,600
Right.

62
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:00,440
So all the files that are ending with dotted bars extension.

63
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:08,740
And as I saved this configuration, you see that those ignored files or folders actually became great.

64
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,370
So they're automatically removed from git def.

65
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:20,000
So basically it just ignores any changes made to these files and they're not displayed as something

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,690
to be checked in.

67
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,960
So now if I do get status.

68
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,990
There you go.

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,120
You see all these files that we ignored are not on the list here, but we have to ignore file.

70
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,600
So we're going to check these remaining stuff in basic.

71
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,680
We just have maned or T.F. And we have terraform look files.

72
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:39,930
Right.

73
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,620
And this one should be checked in, actually, because this is a list of providers that you have installed

74
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,530
locally with their versions and this should be in the repository.

75
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,260
So we're going to add all of these.

76
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,430
We're going to do initial commit.

77
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:07,030
And now if we go back to the repository for the first push, we're going to do upstream Origin Master.

78
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,020
So we're pushing to Master Branch.

79
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:18,490
From local to and you only have to do it first time when you're pushing the branch changes for the first

80
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,600
time to any branch for the very first time after that, you can just do it push.

81
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,520
So we have pushed our changes repository.

82
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,600
If I refresh it.

83
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,440
There you go.

84
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:38,260
You see three files checked in here so we can now work in the repository and make changes, create branches

85
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,320
for trying out different use cases, etc..

86
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,390
So we have all the history in here.
