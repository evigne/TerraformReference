1
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:14,880
So I'm going to click inside and this is our VPC detail of you, and here you see some of the different

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,440
components.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:22,490
First of all, a round table was generated by us for our newly created VPC.

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:31,700
So round table again is like a virtual router in your private network, right?

5
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:40,320
So in the VPC, in virtual private cloud, basically we get our private network right and we have these

6
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,020
IP range available inside that network.

7
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,660
And we have a round table.

8
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,140
Right.

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,060
And round table basically decides where the traffic will be forwarded to within the VPC.

10
00:00:53,580 --> 00:01:00,990
So it actually gives us a round table by default whenever we create a VPC because we didn't specify

11
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,380
it here.

12
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:01,590
Right.

13
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,690
We didn't explicitly create a round table.

14
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,410
It was just generated because every VPC needs one.

15
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:16,500
And we also have a network ACL, which is basically a firewall configuration for our VPC, which applies

16
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,440
to subnets in that VPC.

17
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,140
Right.

18
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,670
So this is a difficult one.

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,320
Let's actually check it out.

20
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,790
And just like the security group, which is firewall configuration for servers.

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:36,600
So on a server level, this is on some level and it also has inbound and outbound rules and by default,

22
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,640
everything is open.

23
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,450
So basically network ACL doesn't actually restrict any traffic.

24
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,740
It is open by default.

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,040
Security groups are closed by default.

26
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,590
And of course, we can configure this as we wish.

27
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,450
So let's go back to VPC again and let's click Inside Row Table.

28
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,080
I'm going to make it bigger.

29
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:05,210
So inside the row table, this is the one we have to actually remove this filter.

30
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,820
You see that we have two tables because one is of the default VPC.

31
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:17,240
It comes with its own row table and this is one for our newly created VPC.

32
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:17,620
Right.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,310
And these are the main row tables or the default ones.

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,040
So this one is ours.

35
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,020
This is our VPC, Edem.

36
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,510
And if I click in Roads.

37
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:37,330
Here you see one road configured, as I said, round table, basically roads, the traffic within a

38
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,050
VPC.

39
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:44,540
So, for example, if we have multiple you see two instances inside the VPC or some other resources

40
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,840
inside, basically what table will be handling and managing the traffic between them.

41
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:57,380
And as you see here, we have one entry and we have a destination, these IP addresses from the range.

42
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,050
So this is a range of IP addresses.

43
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:06,650
And if you remember, this is actually the same range we specified for our VPC right here.

44
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,530
If we go to variables, this is the same exact site, a blog in our VPC.

45
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:20,030
We have a round table that basically handles all the traffic inside our VPC and we know it's a traffic

46
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:25,350
inside of because the IP address range matches our vehicles.

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:31,740
IP address range and local target basically means that this is handled within the VPC.

48
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:40,220
It doesn't go outside to the Internet, it stays within our virtual private cloud and our private network.

49
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,560
Right.

50
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,020
So that is the entry that we have by default.

51
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,130
And that means that our VPC isn't connected to Internet.

52
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:55,930
All the traffic right now is handled within the VPC, but nothing goes outside or comes inside.

53
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:07,850
And if I actually click inside the round table of the default VPC of the region here, I have two entries.

54
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,580
The one is similar to this one.

55
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,350
Which is basically the IP address range of that VPC.

56
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,070
Right.

57
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,740
This is the default BBC IP range.

58
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:28,430
It has local targets, so basically traffic within and we have the second entry, which basically covers

59
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,750
all the IP addresses of the world, each and every one of them, and is a target.

60
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,530
We have Internet gateway.

61
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:44,960
So this means that this round table actually handles or will handle all the traffic coming from the

62
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,680
Internet and living the Internet.

63
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:47,960
Right.

64
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,390
So these Internet gateway is configured for the VPC, for Internet connectivity.

65
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,710
And you can see some other details about the Internet gateway.

66
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,750
However, this is all we need to know at the moment.

67
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,150
So basically.

68
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:13,910
That means that we need the same entry right here so that we can connect our VPC to the Internet and

69
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,300
we're going to create there also with TerraForm.

70
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:26,440
So let's go back to our main T.F. And, you know, next line, we're actually going to create a new

71
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,180
round table.

72
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,040
So what we're going to do is we're going to create a new round table.

73
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,450
We're not going to use the default one.

74
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:40,450
We're going to create a new round table and we're going to create those two rules.

75
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,540
So basically the one for internal traffic and one for connected to Internet.

76
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:54,640
So let's go back to our main terraform file and let's define a resource called A.W. as

77
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,110
Round Table.

78
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,640
And let's actually call it my AMPE.

79
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:17,240
Rhodes table for consistency, and inside here, we're going to configure some attributes, so first

80
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,940
of all, we need to decide which VPC this round table will belong to.

81
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,260
We're creating this round table in our VPC, obviously, so we're going to reference it.

82
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,890
Like this.

83
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,850
Is a second attribute we are going to have to define the rot's.

84
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:47,880
So each road will be its own block, these are basically the entries right here now by default, the

85
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:54,810
entry for the VPC, internal routing is configured automatically, right.

86
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:00,600
So that means that this first entry for the new round table that we're creating.

87
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,410
Not this one.

88
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,700
Not the default one.

89
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:09,560
This entry will be automatically created, so we don't have to specifically define it or we can't actually

90
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,270
define it at all, so we're going to leave that out.

91
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:20,390
So instead, we're going to have to create the second entry, which basically handles the Internet gateway.

92
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,660
And this is going to be the roadblock for that.

93
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,120
And look, we have two attributes.

94
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:35,660
We have Seiter block, and this is going to be basically any IP address which is represented by zeros.

95
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,720
And the second attribute is Gateway.

96
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:50,340
And this is going to be the Internet gateway idea for our table now for our VPC.

97
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:57,020
Actually, we don't have an Internet gateway, so we are going to need to create that resource and.

98
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,600
It's actually pretty easy.

99
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,610
Resource.

100
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:20,110
Adewusi Internet Gateway, and again, let's call it my Internet gateway, and here we have

101
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:29,550
just one attribute that we need to define, which is the PC, right.

102
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:37,120
So we are creating Internet Gateway in the BBC and then we are using that Internet gateway inside our

103
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:47,380
roundtable to tell the roundtable, hey, please handle the requests of the BBC to go to and also come

104
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,620
in from the Internet.

105
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,590
So we're going to reference this Internet gateway here, you know, round table.

106
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:04,800
Like this and Edem, because we're going to need it, right, and finally, we're going to add some

107
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:16,200
texture, we want to take each component so that we know it is created by us and also that it belongs

108
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,150
to the same environment.

109
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,410
Let's use the same prefix.

110
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,330
And let's call it let's call it real Tibble.

111
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:32,030
Like this, and let's use the same take for the Internet gateway.

112
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:35,670
Right.

113
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:44,670
And by the way, even though this resource needs to be created first so that raw table can reference

114
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:50,020
it, it doesn't have to be defined before the resource.

115
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,430
So basically in terraformed, this is a good thing.

116
00:09:53,730 --> 00:10:01,920
That terraform is smart enough to figure out in which order or in which sequence it needs to create

117
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,090
the resources.

118
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:11,340
So, for example, if you have one resource referenced in another, one terraform can figure out that

119
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,280
the first resource needs to be created first.

120
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:22,590
So even if we define it in the, let's say, wrong order, TerraForm will figure out which resource

121
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,960
to create first and so on.

122
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,350
So we don't have to define it in any particular order, which is a good thing about terraform.

123
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,960
It can figure out these kind of dependencies.

124
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,180
So let's leave it like this.

125
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:42,600
So if you look again at our configuration, we have the VPC subnet inside.

126
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:50,580
We're connecting VPC to Internet Gateway and then we are configuring a new round table that we're creating

127
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:58,870
in the VPC to routes all the traffic to and from Internet using this Internet gateway.

128
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:07,530
So think about the round table is a virtual router inside your VPC and you can think about Internet

129
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:14,040
Gateway as a virtual modem that connects you to the Internet and with this configuration.

130
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:21,030
Let's actually do terraform plan and let's see what will happen when we apply this.

131
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,560
And there you go.

132
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:35,830
The BBC and some that are already created, so this time the Internet gateway and roundtable table will

133
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,370
be created.

134
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,420
So let's actually apply.

135
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,710
And let's check.

136
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,160
I'm going to refresh this, and there you go.

137
00:11:51,550 --> 00:12:00,430
We have a round table that we just created and as you see right here, it says not main raw table.

138
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:09,540
So basically, this is like a default round table for our VPC and this is the secondary or not default.

139
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,620
So we have created a new round table.

140
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,920
And if we scroll to the results.

141
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,020
We have the same entry as before.

142
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,350
So this is our VPC IP address range, and as I said, we didn't specify this in our configuration,

143
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:32,400
this was created by default without having to specify it.

144
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,200
So we have that right here.

145
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,230
And this is the one that we configured.

146
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:43,530
We have a routing to and from all the IP addresses using Internet gateway.

147
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,440
And this is the Internet gateway that we created.

148
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:55,970
This one right here, it has the tank and it belongs to our VPC.

149
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,720
So now our VPC is configured to allow Internet traffic.
