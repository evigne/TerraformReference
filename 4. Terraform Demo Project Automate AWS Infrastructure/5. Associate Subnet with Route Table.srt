1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:14,380
Now, there's one more thing we need to configure with our round table, and that is if I actually click

2
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:19,870
in this one, for example, we have a tab called subnet associations.

3
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,930
And basically this means that we have created a round table inside our VPC.

4
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:34,810
However, we need to associate subnets with the round table so the traffic within the subnet can also

5
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,770
be handled by the round table.

6
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,900
So if I click inside here, you see that there is no association defined here.

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:53,250
However, we have a note that by default, when you do not associate subnets to a round table, they're

8
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,750
automatically assigned or associated to the main road table.

9
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,250
Of course, in that VPC where the subnet is running.

10
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:05,540
So the main row table is basically the one that says yes in the main column.

11
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,660
So this is the default row table.

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,530
This is not ours.

13
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,380
This is from the default VPC.

14
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:19,690
And this is actually our two round tables in our boxes, and this is the main one.

15
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:26,830
However, we want the subnet to be associated with the table that we created because this is the one

16
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:35,470
that has Internet gateway configured and we want our subnet to be connected to the Internet gateway

17
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:35,950
as well.

18
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:36,520
Right.

19
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:44,680
So right now, subnet is associated with the main or this round table that doesn't have Internet gateway

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,000
here.

21
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,620
So let's actually change that.

22
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,310
And we're going to do that also in TerraForm.

23
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,660
It's a very straightforward and simple resource.

24
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:04,930
It's called A.W. s Round Table Association.

25
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:13,480
And let's actually call it association round table subnet maybe.

26
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,640
And we just have two parameters, which is the subnet, Edem.

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:33,580
Which we can grab right here from the subnets resource and also don't forget, we always have to use

28
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,190
the ID and the attribute of that object.

29
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,360
And the second attribute, which is the round table, is pretty straightforward.

30
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,510
We're associating this, too.

31
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:52,870
So we just need IDs of the both and row table ID we can grab here.

32
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,370
My table and also don't forget, I did a tribute, so let's play that.

33
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:19,000
And one resource God created and if I refresh the page, no.

34
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:28,960
And go to some associations, you see that now we have an explicit summit association with our roundtable,

35
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:37,610
so our summit or all the resources, including Ishita that we're going to deploy into our summit will

36
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,870
be or all of these requests will be handled by this roundtable.

37
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:49,330
So we can SFH into the issue, for instance, as well as Access Ingenix Web server through the browser.

38
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,740
So all of that is configured.
