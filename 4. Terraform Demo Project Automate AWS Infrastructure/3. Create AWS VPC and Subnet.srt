1
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:16,270
So the first step, as I said, is creating our own VPC and then creating a subnet inside that PC in

2
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:23,200
one of the availability zones of the region and then exposing the VPC to Internet or connecting it to

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,360
the Internet using Internet gateway.

4
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:33,070
So let's do and prepare all of this first before creating the easy to let's actually clean this up a

5
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,040
little bit so that we are starting from a clean state.

6
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,810
First of all, I'm going to remove all the validation and stuff from the variables.

7
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:52,240
And right now we have Seiter blogs and Avildsen on variables and we have the BBC and subnet configuration

8
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,800
from the previous part.

9
00:00:54,310 --> 00:01:01,810
And let's actually make some changes to this to make it more reusable and clean up a little.

10
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:10,450
I have renamed the VPC and Subnet to be my FBC and my subnet to be independent of the environment because

11
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:17,520
let's say we are passing in the environment whether it's develop or staging or production from outside.

12
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:24,510
So all of this is more or less generic and let's actually make this Seiter Block's own variables.

13
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:37,000
So let's create a variable called VPC sided look and another one for subnet Seiter block.

14
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:43,180
And these are going to be separate variables and we're going to assign values to those variables at

15
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,530
the end.

16
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:49,240
So we have the site or blog here and subnet block.

17
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:50,300
Right.

18
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:59,560
So this to change and then we have the availability zone is a variable also set and we can decide in

19
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,050
which aisi of the region the summit will be created and the easy to land will be deployed in.

20
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,300
And let's also change the name tag.

21
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:17,800
So for every component that we're creating, let's give it a prefix of the environment that it's going

22
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,460
to be deployed.

23
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:25,270
And so on a development server, all components will have dev prefix on production environment that

24
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,300
will have proper prefix and so on.

25
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:37,410
So I'm going to create a variable called let's call it in prefix and I'm leaving all the variables empty

26
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:37,930
later.

27
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,290
We can do validation here, we can do type shak description, et cetera.

28
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,510
Right now they're pretty descriptive from the naming, so let's leave it empty.

29
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:55,630
And what we're going to do is we're going to do string interpolation that's basically having variable

30
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,240
value and string glued together.

31
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,550
Right.

32
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,850
So we're going to do something like a devil VPC.

33
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,980
And this Dev will be basically a prefix that is set as a variable.

34
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:15,480
In order to use the variable value, we're going to do dollar sign and curly braces.

35
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:15,830
Right.

36
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:24,250
So using variable outside, not inside the string or inside the quotes is var variable name.

37
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:30,730
If we want to use the variable inside a string because we want to glue it or put it together with another

38
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:40,770
string, we are using sine curly braces and inside here we can do var and the variable name.

39
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:48,700
So this is how we can use variables inside the strings and we're going to do the same for all the other

40
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,500
components.

41
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,820
So let's do prefix first.

42
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:04,060
So this is going to be Dev or Prad or sieging whatever Desh subnet one.

43
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,140
Great.

44
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,110
So we have VPC and we have the subnet.

45
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:16,420
No, let's actually create these two again and we're going to see some of the components that AWB creates

46
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,930
by default whenever we create a new VPC.

47
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,850
So I'm going to save this.

48
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,360
Let's actually assign values to those variables.

49
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:32,010
So I have deleted my terraformed or Tebartz content, so it's completely empty.

50
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,710
We're going to now start setting those values.

51
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,100
So I'm just going to copy all of them.

52
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:46,490
Let's remove the variable here and just leave the names and we're going to assign values to each.

53
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,580
So first of all, VPC, let's give it the same one as before.

54
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,230
It's going to be 10 zero zero zero 16 and.

55
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:08,020
Let's make it 10 zero 10, zero 24.

56
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:20,240
Let's have the availabilities on to you W three B and let's make the environment prefix def so we have

57
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,260
all the values we need.

58
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:28,670
We can also said the region in the provider is an alternative to setting it as an environmental variable

59
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,540
in the command line interface before executing TerraForm.

60
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:38,090
I'm just going to set it here and this is going to be U w three.

61
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:45,510
That's the region and we're creating the subnet in one of these regions, Azeez.

62
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,690
So everything is ready for the simple use case, which we have actually already executed before.

63
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,420
And first of all, let's do terraform PLEN.

64
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,890
This will show us what TerraForm will be executing.

65
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:09,800
And since I have deleted everything created previously, right now I see that subnet will be created

66
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,360
in VPC as well.

67
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,220
So let's actually apply this.

68
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:23,930
I'm going to do auto proof so that I don't need to input confirmation for appli.

69
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,120
And let's see.

70
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:28,820
Great.

71
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,620
So two resources have been added.

72
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:37,100
Let's now go to, you know, use console and let's go to VPC.

73
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,050
And.

74
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,830
Here I have.

75
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:53,770
The Devil VPC, this is the name that we provided here, this was the environmental prefix set here,

76
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,020
DEVE and VPC, so this is the default one that every region comes with.

77
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:03,540
This is what IWC generates for every region by default.

78
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,640
And this is the second one that we just created, and this is the seiter block we specified.

79
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,130
And let's also check the subnets.

80
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:20,560
And again, I have three default summits because by default a default risk comes with default subnets,

81
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,710
one per availability zone in that region.

82
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,120
So if a region has three zones, then it's going to have three subnets.

83
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,830
And this is ours.

84
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:35,020
And it's good to give names to our components because that we can differentiate it from the default

85
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,290
ones.

86
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,940
And we know that it's the one that we created.

87
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,070
So our summit is here as well.

88
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:48,820
Let's actually go inside the VPC and let's see some of the things that Adewusi actually generated for

89
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,410
us once we created this VPC.
