1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:12,210
Another interesting feature of TerraForm is actually it allows us to output a set of attributes and

2
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,190
the values of the resources we just created.

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:22,560
So as you already saw, we are creating resources with just a handful of attributes and the rest of

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,380
the attributes get actually generated by us.

5
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:34,920
And you saw that we can actually see those generated attribute values once we create the resources either

6
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:44,690
in the terraformed state file or using terraform state shows Subcommander for a specific resource.

7
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,070
Right.

8
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,760
In other words, you outputs a specific attribute of a resource we just created in the resource that

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,010
we have defined ourself is using outputs values.

10
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:03,270
So inside the configuration file we can actually define what value we want terraform to output at the

11
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,050
end of applying our configuration from one of the resources.

12
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,960
And we do that by creating output values.

13
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:20,220
So we have the outputs key word here and we are going to give this output value in name.

14
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,020
And let's say in our example, we want to output the ideas of every resource that we are creating.

15
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:33,810
So we want the idea of the VPC as well as a subnet that gets created in each of us.

16
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,810
So first, I'm going to destroy.

17
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,130
Those two resources

18
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,750
by executing, terraformed, destroying.

19
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,750
So both of them are removed and they're removed from the state as well.

20
00:01:54,550 --> 00:02:02,010
And now we are going to recreate them in output ID of each of those two resources.

21
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:09,820
So output first one will call it VPC Edem or let's call it the PC Edem.

22
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:19,080
And in the block, we want to tell terraformed which attributes value.

23
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,770
We want it to output.

24
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,080
Right.

25
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,940
So we have the whole object here.

26
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:34,750
So we have the PC resource type development VPC resource name and this is the whole object, whole PC

27
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,550
object and we want to output the ID of that resource.

28
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,580
Now, again, if you want to check which attributes are available for each resource, we can actually

29
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,450
do a terraform coin.

30
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:59,650
Which will show us a preview of terror forms, planned actions, including the attributes that either

31
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,330
we set or interviews will set for that resource.

32
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,600
And you can actually choose one of the attributes from here to be displayed.

33
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:14,050
In our case, we're choosing Edem of the subnet and ID of VPC pretty straightforward.

34
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,020
These are called IDs on all the resources.

35
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:23,360
So this will be our first output and we are going to define a second output as well.

36
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:36,640
So let's call this the subnet I.D. and this is going to be US subnet resource type that the subnet one

37
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,250
and I did.

38
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,290
And for each attribute you actually have to define its own output.

39
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,240
So you can't have multiple values here even from the same exact resource.

40
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:54,330
So one output value for each attributes we want to output.

41
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,600
So let's actually save this and apply.

42
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,880
It's true or a proof.

43
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:16,900
And here you see, before we had this employee status, now we have output's additionally, and this

44
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,820
gives us our output values.

45
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:24,120
These are the names of our output values, what we call them here.

46
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,700
And these are the actual.

47
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:38,220
Values we have referenced right here, and this is obviously handy, if you are creating resources,

48
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:44,070
maybe a bunch of resources and you want to have ideas of all of them, you can just print it out like

49
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,430
this.

50
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,830
Or as I said previously.

51
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:53,460
Another example is if you are creating server instances and you want their public IP addresses etc,

52
00:04:53,670 --> 00:05:00,930
you can just output it like this so you don't have to do a state show or look into the state file to

53
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,070
find this information.

54
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,430
You have it nicely printed out in here.
