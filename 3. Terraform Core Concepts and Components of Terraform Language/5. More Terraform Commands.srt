1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:12,120
Now, let's say you have a configuration file and you want to check the difference between the current

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,570
state and your configured state, and basically you don't know what the current state is because there

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,490
are multiple people working on the project and you just want to see the difference.

4
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,300
And you don't want to do terraform a man.

5
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,710
You just want to see the difference between current and desired state.

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,990
For that, you can actually execute TerraForm PLEN Command, which is like a preview.

7
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:44,180
Same as what TerraForm Apply Command gives you, but without the actual applying it.

8
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,630
So here you see that just like with appli command, you get this list of actions that TerraForm will

9
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,550
execute in order to get you to the desired state.

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:03,630
And as we have deleted some to using terraformed destroy command, but we still have it in the configuration

11
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,040
file.

12
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:12,690
It basically tells us in terraformed plan that a new resource would be added if you would execute,

13
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,820
terraform, apply.

14
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:24,300
Now, if you are executing TerraForm, Play Command, however, you don't want to always confirm the

15
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:32,760
execution or wait for terraformed to calculate all the changes and then confirm the change.

16
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:41,850
You just want to automatically approve any change you can pass in order to approve Flik.

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,340
And this will basically.

18
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,590
Apply immediately without waiting for your confirmation.

19
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:01,820
And here, as you see, the preview wasn't given and I wasn't asked for confirmation and the change

20
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,750
got applied immediately, we have resources, one added.

21
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:12,640
So we have created back our subunit in a default VPC.

22
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:21,100
Now, what if I wanted to completely destroy my infrastructure and everything that I have created using

23
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,270
this configuration file?

24
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,960
I wanted to clean everything up for that.

25
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,470
We can actually execute, terraform, destroy command.

26
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:38,830
And if we do not provide any targets as parameter, it will basically fund our terraform configuration

27
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,220
file.

28
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:46,570
It will go through all the resources and destroy or basically just remove all the resources one by one

29
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,930
in the correct order that we have defined here.

30
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,110
So let's execute it now.

31
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,520
We get a preview of.

32
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:04,220
What gets destroyed so all three elements or resources will be removed and we can actually confirm this

33
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,040
action in TerraForm will clean everything up.

34
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:15,800
Now, this command is actually handy and can be used if you want to revert exactly what you have created

35
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,900
with this configuration file.

36
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:25,220
And unlike destroy with a specific target, terraform, destroy, which destroys the whole infrastructure

37
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:32,060
is actually pretty convenient because you don't have to worry about in which order and sequence you

38
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,960
have to destroy.

39
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,650
The resources.

40
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,080
TerraForm will figure out which one depends on which and it will basically clean everything up.

41
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,830
So if you're testing something with TerraForm, if you're playing around with resources, then terraform,

42
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,290
destroy.

43
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,640
It will be pretty handy way of just cleaning everything up that you have created.

44
00:03:50,900 --> 00:04:01,040
So now if I go to my account and refresh the boxes, you see the VPC is gone as well as.

45
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:07,110
The subnet one def, if I refresh it here, is gone as well.

46
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,240
So all the resources have been removed.
