1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:11,150
Now that we have an AWB provider configured, we can actually start creating AWB resources using that

2
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:19,010
provider and throughout this course we will actually create a couple of these resources using terraform.

3
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,160
So before you move on with this tutorial, it's important to understand this AWB resources first.

4
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:32,720
So in this video, we're going to go through and understand what VPC and subnet resources are on us,

5
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,610
as well as Internet Gateway, Resource Security Group and so on.

6
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,050
If you already know these resources, then you can skip this video and go to the next one.

7
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:52,220
Now, whenever you create an account in each region, you will have something called a VPC.

8
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,910
So VPC actually stands for virtual private cloud.

9
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,930
So if you go through the service this year, all services list.

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:11,490
In the networking and content delivery part, we have this VPC service, and right now I'm in the Frankford

11
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:19,230
region and here you see I have a VPC, a default one that gets created with some other configuration

12
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:19,590
as well.

13
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,620
And if I switch to another region, for example, Europe, Perry's.

14
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,230
Here I also see a VPC, so I haven't created any of this.

15
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,300
This is out of the box by default in each region.

16
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,270
So VPC in Adewusi is basically your private network, right?

17
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:48,720
When you create resources, virtual servers and so on on us, you obviously don't want other US users

18
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,520
or other abuse accounts to have access to your resources.

19
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:53,780
Right.

20
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,010
You want to protect them and you want only you to have access to them.

21
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:05,490
So because of that, you can create this virtual private cloud on Adewusi infrastructure that only you

22
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,870
have access to and you create this VPC in a specific region.

23
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:17,660
So again, region is basically one of those regions in at least.

24
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:25,270
So, for example, in Perry's region, in the US three, I can create as many pieces as I want.

25
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:32,280
However, region in Adewusi consists of multiple availability zones.

26
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:40,710
Availability zone, in very simple words, is basically a data center of interviews with all those servers

27
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,570
that runs the whole infrastructure.

28
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:51,360
So the virtual machines that you spin up in your area will actually run in one of those, Azeez, because

29
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,400
these are the actual physical locations where the servers will run.

30
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:02,380
So VPC will actually spend all the availability zones in that specific region.

31
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:10,050
So here you see Perry's has three zones and VPC actually spends all of these three zones.

32
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:18,540
So in each region, basically, VPC isolates a space where you are creating your virtual instances,

33
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:25,530
your servers, maybe database instance, some other components from different services, because obviously

34
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:31,320
this is a data center where others also rent virtual servers, create components.

35
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:39,060
So they might actually be running on the same physical machine, same computer, but they will be isolated

36
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,260
in private networks with the PC's.

37
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:53,340
And for bigger corporations that have much more complex application setups, they can actually use multiple

38
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,470
vortices and manage multiple of these private networks in different regions.

39
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,190
Now, what does this VPC include here?

40
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,060
You see, we are in the VPC dashboard.

41
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:16,240
And we have a bunch of other stuff in here, it is basically a virtual representation of network infrastructure.

42
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,960
When you have servers physically in your company, which was a traditional way of hosting servers and

43
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,350
applications before cloud, you have CIS administrators that set up configure and manage this whole

44
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,920
network.

45
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:36,630
They set up the router, they do all the network configuration, configure firewall and so on.

46
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:45,940
So all of this physical network infrastructure is basically now moved in cloud and VPC is the representation

47
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,330
of this.

48
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:54,100
And the reason why you have this default VPC in each region is that whenever you create a new instance,

49
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,110
it has to run inside a VPC or whatever component you're launching.

50
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,630
It has to run, it has to start inside a VPC.

51
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,010
Another thing you see here is subnets.

52
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:15,660
So we have three summits in summits are subnetwork, so VPC is the whole private network and summits

53
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:25,920
are basically component's or sub networks of the VPC, while VPC spends the whole region, all the availability

54
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,740
zones, subnets spend individual availability zones.

55
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,290
So for each three zones, you have their own subnet.

56
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,690
So it's like a private network inside a network.

57
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:49,440
In other interesting thing in the BBC part is that obviously whenever you create a virtual server,

58
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:59,220
it has to get an IP address and in VPC you have a range of private or internal IP addresses in that

59
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,460
range is actually also defined by default and you can even change it.

60
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:10,460
So if I go inside VPC, you have a range of IP addresses.

61
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:18,390
So whenever you create a new instance, a new AC2 instance, an IP address will be assigned to it from

62
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,350
this range.

63
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:28,710
So internal or private IP address is not for Internet traffic, but rather for traffic inside the VPC.

64
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,040
So when you have multiple servers, multiple components inside the VPC, they need to communicate with

65
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,370
each other.

66
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:35,660
Right.

67
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:42,060
So you have an instance with Web application, in other instance with database application, maybe a

68
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,830
third one with some other service.

69
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,300
They all need to communicate.

70
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,010
So private IP address is what allows them to talk to each other.

71
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:59,580
So the IP address range is defined on a VPC level and then each subnet then gets its own IP address

72
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,210
range.

73
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,440
The private IP address range from that total range.

74
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:10,050
It gets like a sub range, so to say you see those sub ranges defined.

75
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:16,890
Now, obviously, when we deploy our Web application on Isleta instance, we want it to be accessible

76
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,650
from Internet right from outside.

77
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:26,940
And for that, in addition to private IP address, we need to assign it a public IP address.

78
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,000
And this is also configured in VPC service.

79
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:39,900
So when we create an easy to instance, it will get a private IP address from the range of the subnets

80
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,930
inside which that instance will start.

81
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:50,250
And it will also get a public IP address, internal one for internal communication inside the VPC and

82
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:57,990
a public IP address for accessing it through the browser for allowing Internet connectivity with your

83
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,910
VPC.

84
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,230
You also have an Internet gateway component.

85
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:10,230
So this basically connects VPC to Internet, to the outside world so that you can get traffic inside

86
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:16,920
your PC to your Web servers, for example, and then you can also send traffic outside if you want to

87
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,390
download some stuff from Internet on your components, et cetera.

88
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:29,010
Now, obviously, in addition to all of these network configuration, you need to secure your components,

89
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:29,320
right.

90
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:37,620
So, for example, you want to control what traffic enters your PC or what traffic reaches individual

91
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,640
instances and components in your PC or in your subnets.

92
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,860
And you want to control what traffic goes out.

93
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,160
Right.

94
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:51,100
So this is a firewall configuration basically for your PC and for individual instances.

95
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:57,540
Now, you can configure that security control on multiple levels in VPC.

96
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:06,270
And Adewusi makes it actually pretty flexible and granular of how you can configure all of this stuff,

97
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:12,290
not just security, but the IP address ranges, the row tables and so on.

98
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,930
And that's why you have this pretty big list of things that you can configure.

99
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:23,930
However, in many cases you will not need some advanced network configuration.

100
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:30,750
Most of the stuff is configured by default, as you see here, because you have these components already

101
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,110
created and configured with some default configuration.

102
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:41,430
And in most simple applications, you will not need to do any crazy configurations here.

103
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:48,330
And since this whole network is private and by default closed to the outside world.

104
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:55,170
So no access from Internet, of course, for your Web applications, you want to configure some Internet

105
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:55,880
access, right.

106
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,260
As well as you want to S.H. into your servers from your laptop.

107
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:05,160
So you want to configure some kind of external access.

108
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,270
And for that.

109
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:17,840
You have components inside that VPC service called Network ECLSS, which are basically firewalls or

110
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,610
firewall rules for subnets, so you can configure this per subnet.

111
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:31,940
And in addition to that, you have security groups which are, again, firewall rules, but on a virtual

112
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,990
machine level.

113
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,740
So inside the BBC, we have the subnet and inside subnets, we're going to have easy two instances,

114
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:47,180
which are basically the virtual servers, and we can configure firewall rules on that virtual server

115
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,970
level using security groups.

116
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:57,110
So you create both of these components on a VPC level and then you assign the Nichols' to individual

117
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:04,530
subnets and assign security groups to individual instances or components inside that VPC.
