1
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:13,920
So now let's actually make some changes to our configuration, as you see, we haven't given names to

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,540
our resources, so basically our subnet doesn't have a name in our VPC, doesn't have a name either.

3
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,760
But it would be good to have a name to differentiate it from other resources.

4
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,940
So let's make the change in our configuration.

5
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,560
So again, we're telling TerraForm.

6
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:38,760
We want the desired state to be subnet with this configuration and a certain name and another subnet

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,420
with this configuration in some name and VPC and TerraForm needs to figure out what changes it needs

8
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,420
to apply to the current state to give us the new desired end result.

9
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,370
So how do we give names to the resources?

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:04,650
We do that by adding a parameter called Tiggs and as you know, takes our key value pairs in HWC and

11
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,580
you can agree to any resource in eight of us and you can have arbitrary key value pairs.

12
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:17,520
So basically you have the TEG key value here being my key, my value.

13
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,930
So basically these are the names that you can decide yourself.

14
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:29,530
For example, this is the VPC environment for developers, whatever.

15
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,590
However, there is one key attribute reserved for a name, and that is name.

16
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:44,540
So if we specify a name tag and set it to some value, that's Sedita development.

17
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:51,210
Basically, this will be assigned as a name and it will appear right here.

18
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,090
And we're going to do the same for the subnets as well.

19
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,570
And takes are basically something that you can define for any resource.

20
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:12,090
So this attribute exists for all the resources and let's say subnet one, then.

21
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:23,240
And let's say they is subnets default, whatever, this is, the default subnet.

22
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,300
In actual scenarios, you will have maybe more descriptive names here, and we can also add another

23
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:40,470
take here and let's actually call it VPC Environment and Death and save it.

24
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,820
And now if we do terraform it put.

25
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:56,170
We have a bunch of output here, so let's actually go through the changes and see what happened here.

26
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:05,720
So first of all, you see another icon here with a slightly yellowish color, which is the tilt character.

27
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:12,640
So basically plus was for creating a resource untilled is for a change.

28
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:21,910
So this means that we are changing an existing resource and a subnet resource with the subnet one name.

29
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:31,390
And inside that resource, we're changing the text attribute and we're adding a new tech, which is

30
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:31,870
a name.

31
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:38,230
And you also see that we have eight other attributes that will be unchanged.

32
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,200
And the same goes for this resource and for VPC we are adding to text.

33
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,290
So tilt is for change, right?

34
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,600
We're changing an existing resource.

35
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,410
And if we enter.

36
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,010
Yes.

37
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:05,650
TerraForm will execute all the changes, and now if we go back to our areas, console and refresh,

38
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,750
you see the name development appeared here as well as in the Tiggs section.

39
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:12,980
Right.

40
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,840
So these are list of takes that we can assign as many takes as we want.

41
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:26,590
And also in the VPC, we have a subnet name which also has text.

42
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:32,890
Now, what happens if we want to remove something from an existing resource?

43
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:39,010
Let's say we want to remove this take here and now if we apply.

44
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:52,110
You see another character, which is minus and it is in red color, so basically, again, TerraForm

45
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,700
went ahead and calculated what is the current state?

46
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,890
The current state was basically this.

47
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:59,280
Right.

48
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,150
And it gets the current state from us.

49
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:11,250
And since we remove these terraform correctly decided that the current state needs to be updated by

50
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,960
removing this tag from the VPC resource on Adewusi.

51
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,100
And the minus basically means removal or deletion.

52
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,520
And this is again where we are changing a resource.

53
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,700
And inside that resource we're removing a tick so we can apply that as well.

54
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,040
And if we refresh our VPC.

55
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,830
And go to.

56
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,530
The text has been removed.

57
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:53,810
Now, what if we wanted to remove the whole resource, let's say we don't want this subnets to anymore?

58
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:59,480
Now, there are two ways of removing a resource that we don't need any more.

59
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:05,020
One option is to remove the resource from terraform file.

60
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:05,730
Right.

61
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:16,010
So if we basically just remove this again, TerraForm will compare the current state, which is we have

62
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:24,740
a subnet in default VPC and the desired DRC, which is no subnet resource specified for default.

63
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,110
VPC TerraForm will decide this resource need to be removed.

64
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,750
So if we do terraform, play again.

65
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:44,910
Here you see that the whole resource is marked with minus because this resource will be removed, of

66
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,830
course, including all the attributes.

67
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:58,020
Now let's actually type in whatever something other than yes and apply will be canceled and revert this.

68
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:06,210
Now, the second option to remove a resource is using TerraForm Command.

69
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:15,130
Terraformed, destroyed in passing in the resource name, right?

70
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:24,990
So we are specifically removing this resource right here and we are passing in a target because we are

71
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,180
dealing with a single resource.

72
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:34,590
And the way we provide the target name is by the resource type.

73
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:49,700
And resource me, all right, so we have the resource type given by provider and the name that we gave

74
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:57,820
resource ourselves and this will tell terraformed to destroy this one specific resource.

75
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,410
So let's actually execute this.

76
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:10,670
And again, similar to terraformed a play, we see the same output, which tells us that the subnets

77
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,650
to resource will be destroyed.

78
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,860
Again, in summary, one to destroy.

79
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,190
And we have to confirm this action.

80
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,490
Let's actually confirm and say yes.

81
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:34,480
And destroy comp. So if we refresh this list, here we go, the fourth subnet is gone.

82
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:40,140
Now, you're probably asking which of these two options is the way to go?

83
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,580
Which one you should use?

84
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,060
And the answer to that is actually terraform.

85
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,690
Why?

86
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:56,970
Because if you destroy specific targets using TerraForm, Destroy Command and with target tech, you

87
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:05,400
end up with a configuration file that doesn't actually correspond to the current state because you still

88
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,000
have that resource inside your configuration file.

89
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:17,400
And especially if you're working with a team and you destroy or change resources using commands and

90
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:24,960
not the configuration file, you basically have a difference between the current state and what's in

91
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,060
the configuration file.

92
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,060
And again, is a best practice of infrastructure is code.

93
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:37,170
Code should represent the changes made to the infrastructure and the resources.

94
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,470
So all the changes should be made through the configuration files.

95
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:48,630
So I would suggest you to use terraform apply and to make the changes through configuration files instead

96
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,040
of comments directly.
