1
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:14,680
Now, when you're working with TerraForm in a team where basically different team members may be executed,

2
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:22,840
terraformed comments locally or you're integrating terraformed in a SkyCity pipeline, you have multiple

3
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,690
places where state can be created.

4
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:25,990
Right.

5
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:32,770
So, for example, if we execute TerraForm Applied from Jenkins' Pipeline, it would create the terraformed

6
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,300
state file on Jenkins'.

7
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:39,180
So the terraformed state file would be only available inside the jenkins' server.

8
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,610
So we don't have access to it locally.

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:48,370
So if I wanted to do TerraForm applied locally to apply some changes on top of that, Tearfund will

10
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:55,720
actually try to create everything again because it will think that I am starting from an empty or fresh

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,930
state, basically.

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,480
So how do we actually share the terraformed state between different environments, maybe different team

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,020
members?

14
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,500
And there is actually a very simple way to do that.

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,930
And it's also a best practice is to configure a remote terraformed state.

16
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,370
So basically a remote storage where this terraformed state file will be stored.

17
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:26,200
It's also good for data backup in case something happens to the server and the state file basically

18
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,580
gets removed.

19
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:27,890
Right.

20
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,360
So to storage in a remote place, security is actually a good way to do that.

21
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,780
So how do we configure a remote storage for TerraForm State file?
