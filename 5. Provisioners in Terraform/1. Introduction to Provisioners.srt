1
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:13,420
Now, there are many cases where you need to execute some sort of commands or maybe a shell script on

2
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:20,770
the virtual servers that you have provisioned with TerraForm, and this is just one of the examples

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:27,130
of executing commands on that easy to server that we just provisioned by passing in.

4
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:36,160
The user data is sort of initial data to be executed on the server in many of the cloud providers like

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:45,250
A.W. as Google Cloud is here and so on, they actually support this attribute to hand over basically

6
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:54,010
some initial execution commands or maybe a file, a script file here for they created the VM to be executed.

7
00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:00,400
However, it is important to differentiate here again that all this data or these commands or script

8
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,910
to be executed will basically be handed over from terraformed to the cloud provider.

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:14,560
So once the SC two instances created by TerraForm and TerraForm gets a status of ISATOU created, basically

10
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:22,540
returns the status to us and we see that in in the come in line is everything was created successfully

11
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,040
and the output.

12
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,260
However, TerraForm doesn't wait for the virtual machine to be initialized.

13
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,280
So basically terraformed job is done at this point.

14
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,580
And once the server gets initialized, the cloud provider in this case, Adewusi, will then execute

15
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,010
these commands on that initialised server.

16
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,270
So this is how it works.

17
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,530
So basically, TerraForm doesn't have any control over what's going to happen next or how these commands

18
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,610
will be executed.

19
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:58,930
And if one of these commands actually fail and for example, Docker Run doesn't work because Docker

20
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:05,740
wasn't properly installed or some permission or whatever happens there, then TerraForm will not know

21
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,820
anything about the error.

22
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:13,220
So we won't get that information without access into the server and then debugging it.

23
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:22,480
So that's important to know that even though we are able to pass on the data or initial comments to

24
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,330
configure the server, it is actually not in terraformed control anymore.

25
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:38,020
Now, with that said, there are still ways to execute commands, execute scripts from TerraForm.

26
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:45,130
And it is important to mention that because TerraForm has its own concept of parameters for executing

27
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,310
commands and scripts on virtual machines.

28
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,830
And it's good to know what these concepts are, how they're used and what it's about.
